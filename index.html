        When, while the lovely valley teems<br>with <p id="red"> vapour around me </p>, and the<br>meridian sun strikes the upper<br> surface of the impenetrable foliage of<br> my trees, and but a few stray gleams<br> steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw<br> myself down among the tall grass by<br> the trickling stream;<br><br>
        and, as I lie close to the earth, a<br> thousand unknown plants are noticed<br> by me: when I hear the buzz of the<br> little world among the stalks, and<br> grow familiar with the countless<br> indescribable forms of the insects and<br> flies, then I feel the presence of the<br> Almighty, who formed us in his own<br> image, and the breath of that<br> universal love which bears and<br> sustains us, as it floats around us in<br> an eternity of bliss; and then, my<br> friend, when darkness overspreads<br> my eyes, and heaven and earth seem<br> to dwell in my soul and absorb its<br> power, like the form of a belovedv<br> mistress, then I often think with<br> longing, Oh, would I could describe<br> these conceptions, could impress<br> upon paper all that is living so full<br> and warm within me, that it might be<br> the mirror of my soul, as my soul<br> is the mirror of the infinite God!

        The sunset faded to twilight before<br> anything further happened. The<br> crowd far away on the left, towards<br> Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard<br> now a faint murmur from it. The little<br> knot of people towards Chobham<br> dispersed. There was scarcely an<br> intimation of movement from the pit.

        <div class="text">
            It was this, as much as anything, that<br> gave people courage, and I suppose<br> the new arrivals from Woking also<br> helped to restore confidence. At any<br><p id="green">rate, as the dusk</p> came on a slow,<br> intermittent movement upon the<br> sand pits began, a movement that<br> seemed to gather force as the stillness<br> of the evening about the cylinder<br> remained unbroken. Vertical black<br> figures in twos and threes would<br> advance, stop, watch, and advance<br> again, <p id="accent">spreading out</p> as they did so in<br> a thin irregular crescent that<br> promised to enclose the pit in its<br> attenuated horns. I, too, on my side<br> began to move towards the pit.

        Then I saw some cabmen and others<br> had walked boldly into the sand pits,<br> and heard the clatter of hoofs and the<br> gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling<br> off the barrow of apples. And then,<br> within thirty yards of the pit.

            One morning, when Gregor Samsa<br> woke from troubled dreams, he found<br> himself transformed in his bed into a<br> horrible vermin. He lay on his<br> armour-like back, and if he lifted his<br> head a little he could see his brown<br> belly, slightly domed and divided by<br> arches into stiff sections. The bedding<br> was hardly able to cover it and<br> seemed ready to slide off any<br> moment.<br><br>
            His many legs, pitifully thin compared<br> with the size of the rest of him, waved<br> about helplessly as he looked. "What's<br> happened to me?" he thought. It<br> wasn't a dream. His room, a proper<br> human room although a <a href="">little too<br> small</a>, lay peacefully between its four<br> familiar walls. A collection of textile<br> samples lay spread out on the table -<br>Samsa was a travelling salesman -<br> and above it there hung a picture that<br> he had recently cut out of an<br> illustrated magazine and housed in a<br> nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady<br> fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa<br> who sat upright, raising a heavy fur<br> muff that covered the whole of her<br> lower arm towards the viewer.<br> Gregor then turned to look out the<br> window at the dull weather.
